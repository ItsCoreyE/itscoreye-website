# 🏆 Milestone Discord Bot

Automatically posts milestone achievements to your Discord server when you complete milestones in your admin panel.

## 🎯 Features

- **Automatic Notifications** - Posts to Discord when milestones are marked as completed
- **Rich Embeds** - Beautiful Discord embeds with category-specific colors and emojis
- **Progress Tracking** - Shows completion stats for each category and overall progress
- **Category Support** - Handles Revenue (💰), Sales (🛍️), and Item Release (🎨) milestones
- **Role Pinging** - Notifies your Discord role when achievements are unlocked

## 📁 Files Created

- `milestone_notifier.py` - Python script that posts to Discord
- `src/app/api/discord/milestone-webhook/route.ts` - API endpoint for webhook integration
- `src/app/api/milestones/route.ts` - Enhanced milestone API with Discord integration
- `test_milestone_notification.py` - Test script to verify Discord notifications work

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- `requests` library for Python: `pip install requests`
- Your Discord webhook URL (already configured)

### 2. Discord Configuration
✅ **Already Done:**
- Discord channel: `#milestones` in your ItsCoreyE Zone
- Webhook URL: `https://ptb.discord.com/api/webhooks/1396159506131718244/...`
- Role ping: `1395779215944581271`

### 3. Test the System
Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_milestone_notification.py
```

This will send a test milestone notification to your `#milestones` channel.

## 🎮 How It Works

### Workflow:
1. **Admin Panel** → You toggle a milestone to "completed" and click "Save Changes"
2. **Milestone API** → Detects newly completed milestones and calculates progress stats
3. **Discord Webhook** → Calls the Python script with milestone data
4. **Discord Post** → Rich embed appears in your `#milestones` channel with role ping

### Example Discord Message:
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is hardcoded in `milestone_notifier.py`:

USER_ID = "3504185"
USERNAME = "ItsCoreyE"  
PING_ROLE_ID = "1395779215944581271"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Individual Notification:
```bash
python test_milestone_notification.py
```

### Test Through Admin Panel:
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Toggle any milestone to completed
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Check your `#milestones` Discord channel

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Python not found:**
- Make sure Python is installed and in your system PATH
- Try `python3` instead of `python` on some systems

**Requests module missing:**
```bash
pip install requests
```

**Discord webhook fails:**
- Check that the webhook URL is correct
- Verify the `#milestones` channel exists
- Ensure the webhook has permission to post

**No notifications in Discord:**
- Check the Next.js console logs for errors
- Verify the Python script runs without errors
- Test with the test script first

### Debug Logs:
The system logs detailed information to help with debugging:
- Milestone API logs when notifications are triggered
- Python script logs Discord posting attempts
- Webhook endpoint logs execution details

## 🎉 Success!

Your milestone Discord bot is now ready! Every time you achieve a milestone and mark it as completed in your admin panel, your Discord community will be automatically notified with a beautiful achievement announcement.

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing UGC notification setup, using the same role ping and following the same design patterns for consistency.
